      Dietrich Bonhoeffer (4 February 1906 â€“ 9 April 1945) was a German pastor, theologian, spy, anti-Nazi dissident, and key founding member
      of the Confessing Church. His writings on Christianity's role in the secular world have become widely influential, and his book The Cost 
      of Discipleship has become a modern classic. Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to Nazi
      dictatorship, including vocal opposition to Hitler's euthanasia program and genocidal persecution of the Jews. He was arrested in April
      1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years. Later he was transferred to a Nazi concentration camp. After
      being accused of being associated with the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, he was quickly tried, along with other accused plotters, including
      former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office), and then executed by hanging on 9 April 1945 as the Nazi 
      regime was collapsing.</p>
